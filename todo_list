Fixed loopholes:

1. After clicking on notificaton and the popup comes up the close button is not working
2. Why the notification first need to go to lead dashboard and the pop up its better if the user click on it and instead of going to lead_dashboard
it shows on the same current page.

3. once we add the price in it and after if we want to change the qualification the price is still there so it shouldnt be there when we are changing 
qualification. and appointment if we want to reschedule it it should send the mail again after rescheduling (completed, but in )

4. Add new user: whiile inviting the new user the password field shows blank 
5. Add new user : when we edit the user the user profile is not storing there in database its storing but not in radio buttons
6. Assign to : In leads assign to button is not working 


7. Qualification: When we are changing the qualification to rappel to something else after saving rappel, it should remove the rappel data which is in appoint
ment and same for  the signe cpf and price (after saving the save button is not working)


8.when we add the lead from adding lead and use the assign button and save its not working coming an error for the page 
9.Notification: in notification page the sender name is not correct its not showing who is sending 
10. in notification page, we see al the notifications but  we need when we click on notification it will open up the modal like the same thing which we did 
for notification bell

for now these are the errors which i saw if there is any please mention it
